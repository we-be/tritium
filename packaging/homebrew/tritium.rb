# The formula template. `make formula` fills in the version and the sha256 of
# each tarball from what `make dist` built, and the release workflow attaches
# the result to the GitHub release as `tritium.rb`. The tap at
# github.com/we-be/homebrew-tritium copies the latest one within the hour, so
#   brew install we-be/tritium/tritium
# installs the current release. (Homebrew no longer installs a formula from a
# bare file, so the attached one is the tap's source and a record of the
# checksums, not something to install directly.)
#
# Installs the five binaries (`tritium`, `tritium-cli`, `tritium-monitor`,
# `tritium-msg`, `tritium-load`) from the release tarballs — no compiler needed
# on the machine installing this, matching a zero-dependency project that ships
# as static binaries. (linux-arm, the GOARM=6 build for a Pi Zero, isn't
# packaged here — not a Homebrew target.)
